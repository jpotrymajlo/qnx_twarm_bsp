Please review the following known issue with the Ethernet driver on the
AT91SAM9263

Network driver drops packet due to transmitter under run. A known HW limitation
with the Ethernet transmitter and usage of slow SDRAM memory will cause the
transmitter to generate under run and flush all packets/fragments in the
transmitter queue. For more details about this problem refer to the Atmel
AT91SAM9263 reference manual (doc6249.pdf) section 49.2.6 “EMACB Errata” fo
more details.

To overcome this problem, every packet should be defragmented and the buffer
RAM as well as the buffer descriptors should be taken from SRAM rather than
SDRAM.
